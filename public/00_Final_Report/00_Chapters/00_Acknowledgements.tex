\noindent I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Professor Erik Birgersson. Professor Birgersson has provided me with profound insights and knowledge on various topics, including polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell stacks, machine learning, deep learning, and the use of COMSOL. He has also taught me how to effectively present to a scientific audience and the importance of learning independently. His enthusiasm and encouragement have made this journey a truly pleasant and enriching experience.
